- use the flutter image manipulation library
	- adjust contrast so that script is perfectly black and white
	- when detecting words, automatically straighten the lines/rotate the image so that they are perfectly parallel

- Once script is uploaded and text has been detected:
	- Prompt user to tap on one of their lines
	- It will select that line with a highlighted box, and it will also select other boxes that it thinks are the same character, and you press a check box to confirm those automatic selections
	- When you upload future images, it will have automatic selections at the very beginning, and you confirm/deny as well.


- Taskbar that appears on the side while you are looking at lines
    - maybe make this like an action button sort of thing?
    - includes:
        - settings button 
            - configure which character is yours?
            - maybe have this on the upload image page as a popup?
- general settings button
    - configure left/right handed mode
- have a back button on the top left to return to script screen
- have buttons to advance/go back pages
- Character menu that allows you to select which character you're playing
    - be able to drag characters around to merge them together (if it misdetected a character's name)
    - be able to rename characters (if misdetected what it actually is)
- be able to save scripts
- be able to rearrange script pages
- be able to zoom in on script images / display them bigger on the selection screen. 
- allow multiple image selection

- After you tap on an image, it opens it in full screen
- then there will be a button to start showing lines
